# viewport-frozen-layer-001

Two viewports on one layout looking at the same model space, which has a line on WALLS and one on DOORS. DOORS is frozen in the first viewport only, so it shows in the second and not in the first.

The record is `expected.math.json`, authored from its parameter file by `tools/authoring/author_probes.py` and never from a reader or converter output. `source.dwg` was written by the open writer (acadrust, `tools/r0-open/rust`) from the record's f64 bits, and `read.acadrust.json` is what acadrust's reader found in it. Only one reader has looked at this drawing so far, and no STEP converter has (STEP cannot express a viewport), so the scope is `READER_MAPPING_ONLY`.
